Here there are some executable files from labview. The first one works without arduino (app.exe) and the other one doesn't (arduinoApp.exe). 
If you want to use arduinoApp.exe, you need to first connect to analog pins (1,2 & 3) and connect the arduino to your laptop (you must also have controllers for arduino there).
